Título: Compositions and methods for regulating RNA stability using polypyrimidine
     tract proteins
Resumo: Compositions and methods for regulating CD154 gene expression are provided
     that rely on the interaction of polypyrimidine tract proteins with the
     3'-untranslated region of CD154.
Reivindicações: 1.  A method for identifying agents that modulate the level or activity of a polypyrimidine tract protein comprising contacting a test cell, which contains a polypyrimidine
tract protein and a cis-acting element of a CD154 3'-untranslated region operatively-linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a reporter, with an agent and detecting the expression of a product of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the reporter in the
test cell. 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein a decrease in the expression of a product of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the reporter, in the test cell contacted with the agent relative to the expression of the product of the nucleic acid sequence
encoding the reporter in a test cell not contacted with the agent, indicates that the agent causes a decrease in the level or activity of polypyrimidine tract protein of SEQ ID NO:2 or an increase in the level or activity of polypyrimidine tract protein
isoform of SEQ ID NO:1. 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein an increase in the expression of a product of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the reporter in the test cell contacted with the agent relative to the expression of the product of the nucleic acid sequence
encoding the reporter in a test cell not contacted with the agent, indicates that the agent causes an increase in the level or activity of polypyrimidine tract protein of SEQ ID NO:2 or a decrease in the level or activity of polypyrimidine tract protein
isoform of SEQ ID NO:1.
